n the example illustrated above, paying and signing your receipt is like logging in with your username and password. The receipt is like the session id that is created by Facebook when you first log in, and that receipt is what is used to identity you for the remainder of your visit. You never have to show your credit card or sign the receipt again - the number on the receipt (like a session id) is all you need for a back and forth exchange between yourself (the client) and the employee (the server). This way, you donâ€™t run the risk of identity theft by exposing your credit card numbers multiple times (like a cookie being passed back and forth between requests), and you can access your food with the number issued by Shake Shack.
